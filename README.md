# BO4-Lucy-Menu
This is a FREE BO4 GSC Zombie mod menu! 
This menu is currently set to only work on IX and is open source so feel free to do whatever you want to it or with it :)


HOW TO INSTALL:
Step 1 -> Watch and follow along this youtube video to correctly install the injector and learn how to inject: https://youtu.be/AGcMTisF6iA

Step 2 -> Download the files here on github and replace them with the default project you make within the Installer.exe (https://github.com/G1llam/BO4-Lucy-Menu)

Step 3 -> Launch BO4 and go to zombies and then inject when pre game and start the map called IX.

 - Various menu improvements and clean ups 



==== Version 1.2 ====

   - Can now edit other peoples stats without them needing to download the menu

This update will make it easier to inject the menu due to me fixing the part where you have to cross over the lucy files with the default project files
